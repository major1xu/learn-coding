(Update 12-18-2025)
How to run some of the files, espcially ipynb file. We need to start Anaconda Navigator App, and start Jupiter Notebook webapp, from there we can see something like:
http://127.0.0.1:8889/?token=4fd931de209816ff9b9464fdccacd2e425b87ab5ae14cc4f

In the terminal, we will need that to run the code in VS Code.
