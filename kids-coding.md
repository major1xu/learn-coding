Families,

It was an exciting week at Maryville Summer Science and Robotics! I hope that your little computer scientist enjoyed their time learning to code!  Let's not let the learning stop just because camp week is over.  Here are some resources for your children to enjoy at home:

Code.org is by far my favorite. There are lessons (and games) available for pre-readers to advanced coders. I set up a special class for your kiddos and will be sending their login info in a separate email.  It is also on their ID tags they took home from camp today. Have fun exploring!

Scratch is also a website your campers learned about this week. We didn't set up accounts in Scratch, so you can start from the beginning to sign up. It is always free and you are also able to learn and play as a guest. 

Code Monkey This site we did not use in class, but I have utilized it before and it is a ton of fun!  You can play for free for a bit, but then there is a cost associated with this resource. I believe there is also an app!

Khan Academy is another one of my go-to sites for lessons not only in coding, but math too! 

Scratch Jr. Don't let the "Jr." fool you! They claim this app is only for 4-7 years old, but I've had teenagers enjoy playing with Scratch Jr. more than Scratch itself! It is only available in app form, but I think you'll agree, it is a must have app! (And its free!)

Watch for your computer scientist's code.org login within a future email!  Thank you for attending Coding 101!  I hope to see you during future summers!
